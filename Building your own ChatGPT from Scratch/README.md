# GPT-from-scratch

This project is a TensorFlow implementation of Andrej Karpathy's ng-video-lecture project, which can be found at the original link: [ng-video-lecture](https://github.com/karpathy/ng-video-lecture/blob/master).

## About the Project

Andrej Karpathy's invaluable resource, guiding the process of coding GPT from the ground up and enabling it to generate text reminiscent of Shakespeare, serves as an excellent learning tool for delving into natural language processing and machine learning models. This TensorFlow implementation aims to replicate the functionality of the original project while utilizing the TensorFlow framework. This project uses tensorflow 2.10.1.

## Files

- **input.txt**: This file includes the Shakespear work in a single file. It serves as the input for training both the Bigram model and the GPT model.

- **bigram.ipynb**: A Jupyter notebook that includes code for training a basic Bigram model. This model is a simple n-gram language model that can generate text.

- **gpt.ipynb**: A Jupyter notebook that includes the code for building a GPT model from scratch. It covers the implementation of a basic transformer architecture for text generation. You can follow the notebook to understand the inner workings of GPT.

- **gpt_model_weights.h5**: Pre-trained weights for the GPT model after 5,000 iterations. You can use these weights to generate text using the implemented GPT model without going through the training process.

- **more.txt**: This file includes additional text data so that you can train the gpt on more data.
